<h2>Abstract</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to draw conclusions about populations from sample data, typically represented in tables. With the prevalence of graph representations in real-life applications, hypothesis testing on graphs is gaining importance. In this work, we formalize node, edge, and path hypotheses on attributed graphs. We develop a sampling-based hypothesis testing framework, which can accommodate existing hypothesis-agnostic graph sampling methods. To achieve accurate and time-efficient sampling, we then propose a <strong>Path-Hypothesis-Aware SamplEr</strong>, PHASE, an <em>m</em>-dimensional random walk that accounts for the paths specified in the hypothesis. We further optimize its time efficiency and propose \(\text{PHASE}_{\text{opt}}\). Experiments on three real datasets demonstrate the ability of our framework to leverage common graph sampling methods for hypothesis testing, and the superiority of hypothesis-aware sampling methods in terms of accuracy and time efficiency.</p>

<h2>Key Features</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<ul>
  <li><strong>Efficient Sampling</strong>: Our framework provides efficient sampling methods for large attributed graphs</li>
  <li><strong>Hypothesis Testing</strong>: Support for various hypothesis testing scenarios on nodes, edges, and paths</li>
  <li><strong>PHASE Sampler</strong>: A novel Path-Hypothesis-Aware SamplEr using <em>m</em>-dimensional random walks</li>
  <li><strong>Optimized Implementation</strong>: Includes both basic and optimized versions (\(\text{PHASE}_{\text{opt}}\)) of the sampler</li>
</ul>

<h2>Experimental Results</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>Our comprehensive experiments on MovieLens, DBLP, and Yelp datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach:</p>

\(\text{PHASE}_{\text{opt}}\) consistently outperforms the top 5 hypothesis-agnostic samplers across most hypotheses and sampling proportions. Its advantage is less pronounced for easier hypotheses with abundant relevant structures in \(\mathcal{G}\), where hypothesis-agnostic samplers perform comparably. However, for harder hypotheses (e.g., with <strong>(hard)</strong> tag), \(\text{PHASE}_{\text{opt}}\) shows clear superiority, achieving the highest accuracy at all sampling proportions.
